Simple terminal-based Python portscanner

IMPORTANT!!! THIS IS FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY!!! I NEED TO INFORM YOU THAT SCANS LIKE THE ONES THIS PROGRAM PERFORMS ARE ILLEGAL TO DO WITHOUT THE
EXPLICIT CONSENT OF THE WEBSITE OR NETWORK OWNER!!! THEREFORE, ONLY USE THIS ON WHETHER YOUR HOME NETWORK/OWN WEBSITE OR A NETWORK/WEBSITE YOU HAVE THE EXPLICIT ALLOWANCE TO
DO SO!!!

An example for a website you are allowed to scan is "scanme.nmap.org".

This is a simple terminal-based portscanner written in Python. It is capable of determining whether a certain port on a website service is open or closed.
It comes with two modes: Scanning a specific port number and scanning a user defined range of ports. It also takes IPv4 addresses or website domains as input.

I came across the idea of creating a simple portscanner while learning about IT-security and information gathering. I created this one in order to better
understand how tools in this field basically work behind the scences.

The scanner is very slow so far and has been created so intentionally, in an attempt to prevent abuse.
